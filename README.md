A CodinGame code golf score table

## What?

A different view on my CodinGame code golf scores.

[Check it live](https://code-golf-table.azul.workers.dev/)

## Why?

CodinGame code golf scores don't fit a screen.
It's difficult to have an overview on your scores.
Using this table is much more easy to see my overall performance.

## How?

A [Clouldflare worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) generates the html table by using the (undocumented) CodinGame REST API.
